> **Note**  
> These instructions assume you are running this challenge at the [Humber Polytechnic](https://humber.ca/) campus in room CTI306. If you are not, there are instructions at the bottom of this page on creating your own copies of this puzzle.

1. There are seven copies of this puzzle in the plastic drawers in room CTI306. Sort the blocks based on their colour. There should be six 2 x 2 x 1 blocks and three 1 x 1 x 1 blocks.

2. Instruct the class that:

   - The coloured patterns on the blocks are not part of the puzzle.
   - You may not disassemble the blocks.

3. Put students into groups (max seven groups). Give each group a puzzle. Instruct groups to use the blocks to build a perfect cube.

4. **Hint!** If groups are struggling, encourgae them to calculate the overall size of the cube. The overall size of the cube will be 3 x 3 x 3 (like a Rubiks Cube).

5. **Hint!** If groups continue to struggle, inform the groups that one of the 1 x 1 x 1 blocks will go in the exact middle of the puzzle.
